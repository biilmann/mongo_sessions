= mongo_sessions

MongoDB Session store for Rails 3 and Rack applications

Uses the ruby Mongo driver to store sessions in a MongoDB collection.

= When Using in Rails 3 Applications

To use the session store in rails (In this example with Mongoid) add the rails store to your Gemfile:

    gem "mongo_sessions", :require => "mongo_sessions/rails_mongo_store"
  
And change config/initializers/session_store.rb (mongoid:3.0.16, mongo_sessions:0.3.5) to something like:

    MyApp::Application.config.session_store :mongo_store, key: '_MyApp_session', collection: lambda { Mongoid.default_session[:sessions] }

= When Using in Rack Applications

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

    gem "mongo_sessions", :require => "mongo_sessions/rack_mongo_store"

If you are not using Bundler.require:

    require "mongo_sessions/rack_mongo_store"

Add the Rack Middleware to your app:
    
    use Rack::Session::MongoStore

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
